In this folder is the Sample App. It does a few things:

Connects to the database. This uses the database for one group. The groups, and the connections are below.
Does a SELECT statement to get data from the database
Does a UPDATE statmenet to update a record in the database
Does an INSERT to insert a customer
Does a DELETE to delete the customer it added
Creates a form with a button, and writes data to a JTextArea


There is a library called JDBC that is used to do the Queries. You will have to get the jar file from this folder.



If you need to look at the database, there are some free tools, like NavCat that let you examine the structure and the data in the DB.
